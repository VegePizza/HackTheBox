# xFreeRDP

Hereâ€™s a summary of the **FreeRDP commands** and steps you used earlier:

***

#### **1. Ran FreeRDP Without Specifying a Username**

You attempted to connect to a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server using `xfreerdp` without explicitly providing a username:

```bash
xfreerdp /v:10.129.238.226
```

#### **2. Key Observations from the Output**

1. **Default Username**:
   *   Since you didnâ€™t specify a username, FreeRDP used your local system login name (`vegepizza`) by default:

       ```
       No user name set. - Using login name: vegepizza
       ```
2. **Self-Signed Certificate Warning**:
   *   FreeRDP detected that the RDP server was using a **self-signed certificate** and warned of a certificate mismatch:

       ```
       WARNING: CERTIFICATE NAME MISMATCH!
       The hostname used for this connection (10.129.238.226:3389) does not match the name given in the certificate: Explosion
       ```
   * This occurred because the certificateâ€™s Common Name (CN) was `Explosion`, while you connected using the IP address (`10.129.238.226`).
3. **Prompt to Trust the Certificate**:
   * You were prompted to trust the certificate temporarily (`Y`), permanently (`T`), or not at all (`N`).

***

#### **Possible Resolutions You Could Apply**

1. **Specify a Username and Password**:
   *   Add the `/u:` flag to provide a valid username:

       ```bash
       xfreerdp /v:10.129.238.226 /u:Administrator
       ```
2. **Bypass Certificate Validation**:
   *   Use the `/cert:ignore` option to ignore certificate warnings (trusted environments only):

       ```bash
       xfreerdp /v:10.129.238.226 /u:Administrator /cert:ignore
       ```
3. **Trust the Certificate**:
   * At the prompt, you could choose:
     * `Y` to trust the certificate temporarily.
     * `T` to trust it permanently and save it in the `~/.config/freerdp/known_hosts` file.

***

#### **Summary**

* You used FreeRDP to connect to an RDP server but encountered a **self-signed certificate warning** due to a name mismatch.
* The server was reachable, but the lack of a specified username and the certificate issue required manual intervention.
* Potential fixes included specifying a username (`/u:`) and bypassing certificate validation (`/cert:ignore`) for easier access in trusted environments.
